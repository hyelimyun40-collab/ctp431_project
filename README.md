##Interactive Piano Video Instrument

This project is a web-based interactive musical instrument that combines keyboard input, polyphonic audio playback, and synchronized video feedback.
Users can play a piano-like interface using their physical keyboard, triggering corresponding audio samples and visual responses in real time.

The instrument is designed as a sample-based polyphonic player, allowing multiple notes (chords) to be played simultaneously while displaying a single representative video for visual clarity.


✨ Features

Keyboard-controlled piano interface
Physical keyboard keys (A–W–S–E–D–F–T–G–Y–H–U–J–K–O-L-P-:-") are mapped to musical notes.

Polyphonic audio playback
Multiple notes can be played at the same time, enabling chord performance.

An ADSR envelope was applied using a gain node to shape the attack, decay, sustain, and release of each sound, resulting in more natural and expressive piano playback.

Sample-based sound engine
Each note triggers a pre-recorded audio sample, preserving the original timbre.

Synchronized video feedback
A video corresponding to the most recently pressed note is displayed while notes are active.

Interactive visual UI
On-screen piano keys visually respond to user input.

Browser-based execution
Runs entirely in the web browser without any additional software installation.
